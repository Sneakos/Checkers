# Connect Four
Play an AI in a game of connect four!

This is a somewhat working AI for connect four. It checks a limited number of moves ahead, and it's a bit laggy/weird. But the algorithm does work, and it can at least keep up with you for the most part. 

Also, I currently don't have a "win" confirmation set, so you can keep playing after you win. Oh well, I'll fix that when I have time

Finally, there is both a text-based board and a (more laggy) graphics board. Play whichever your tiny heart desires
